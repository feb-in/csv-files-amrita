Chip shortage forces Jaguar Land Rover to halt production,last month,"Jaguar Land Rover will halt production at its two main factories due to a shortage of computer chips as Covid-related supply issues continue to blight the global car industry. The company will temporarily shut down production at its plants in Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands and Halewood on Merseyside from Monday. Sources warned that the shortage of parts could affect other British plants. Honda has blamed supply issues for delays and Renault said on Thursday that supplies of chips to return were unlikely to return to normal until the third quarter of the year. A senior car industry source said: ""All car manufacturers in the UK - and around the world - have very limited visibility on chip supplies, sometimes just a week. It's a combination of so many factors - Covid, Brexit and the Suez Canal blockage among them."" The shutdown at JLR is expected to last at least a week, although it will monitor chip supplies before committing to a date for restarting. Models affected by the stoppages include the Jaguar XE, XF and F-Type sports car at Castle Bromwich, and the Discovery Sport and Range Rover Evoque at Halewood. The shutdown was first reported by the Guardian."
